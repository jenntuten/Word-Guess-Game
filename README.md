# Word-Guess-Game
This is my first full attempt at a JavaScript project. \
\
What seemed like a fairly challenging task took nearly every bit of free time I had between the day it was assigned--and the night before it was due. Who knew a hangman game could be so complex?

# A Few Notes About This Assignment
Going into this bootcamp, JavaScript was a completely new concept to me. With that in mind, I'm sharing a few tweaks I had to make to my code to adapt and overcome (and return to later once I have a better grasp overall).\
\
**Press any key to get started.** I changed this to "Enter" because typing a letter not matching the word automatically decremented the remaining letters.\
\
**Wins.** Each time the game resets, everything refreshes and a win counter is not displayed (currently).
# Additional Notes
**Choices.** Choices are limited to letters so that a number or other key doesn't count against the player.\
\
**Blank spaces.** I tried to use underscores with a space separating them (just to make it clear how many letters there were in each word), but underscores would get stuck at the end in that case. After quite a bit of experimenting and using undo/redo several times, I found that using dashes would show separation between the characters--and it wouldn't display any dashes out of place.\
\
**Overall thoughts.** With plenty of practice, a great deal of support from my instructional team and tutor, I was able to make it past several significant road blocks that no amount of googling could seem to solve. And, using console.log early and often has been instrumental in getting over those final obstacles.
